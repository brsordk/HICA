## HICA: A MATLAB-based Hierarchical Image Clustering Algorithm for Classifying Parts Suitable for Additive and Traditional Manufacturing Technologies

### Brief Description of HICA
HICA is a software tool developed in MATLAB, specifically designed to differentiate parts suitable for additive and traditional manufacturing technologies based on part geometry only. The software tool can classify image datasets, CAD datasets, and combined datasets with both images and CAD models. The tool can reduce time and effort spent for selectin a manufacturing process by providing a preselected set of parts that are more suitable for additive manufacturing. The software is aimed to support decision making for traditional manufacturing companies that consider expanding their production capabilities by introducing additive manufacturing processes to their production portfolio.
